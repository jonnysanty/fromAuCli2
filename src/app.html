<p>But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Do an almighty painting with us. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

<p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.</p>

<p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>

<p>It all happens automatically. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>

<p>Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>

<p>There comes a nice little fluffer. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.</p>

<p>There we are. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>

<p>You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Don't fight it, use what happens. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

<p>Trees grow however makes them happy. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.</p>

<p>You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We'll do another happy little painting. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.</p>

<p>Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Play with the angles. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>

<p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.</p>

<p>There we go. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. See there, told you that would be easy. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.</p>

<p>In your world you can create anything you desire. A fan brush can be your best friend. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Work that paint. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.</p>

<p>At home you have unlimited time. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

<p>A happy cloud. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Use your imagination, let it go. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let the paint work. Don't fiddle with it all day.</p>

<p>The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>

<p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.</p>

<p>Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

<p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? There comes a nice little fluffer. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want.</p>

<p>We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. We'll put a happy little sky in here. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's have a happy little tree in here. It takes dark in order to show light.</p>

<p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.</p>

<p>Let's build some happy little clouds up here. We can fix anything. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>

<p>Let's have a little bit of fun today. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>

<p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue This is a fantastic little painting. The light is your friend. Preserve it. There we are. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.</p>

<p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Every day I learn. Zip. That easy.</p>

<p>Just let these leaves jump off the brush This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Just make little strokes like that. And maybe a little bush lives there. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.</p>

<p>Everybody needs a friend. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Let's have a nice tree right here. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>

<p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. This is the way you take out your flustrations.</p>

<p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.</p>

<p>The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. And just raise cain. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>

<p>Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. We'll put a happy little bush here. Poor old tree.</p>

<p>Anything you want to do you can do here. Fluff that up. Every time you practice, you learn more.</p>

<p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree.</p>

<p>Working it up and down, back and forth. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.</p>

<p>This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.</p>

<p>See there how easy that is. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's get crazy. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>

<p>Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Learn when to stop. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>

<p>Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Put it in, leave it alone. Imagination is the key to painting.</p>

<p>There it is. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>

<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Now then, let's play. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.</p>

<p>Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. We'll play with clouds today. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>

<p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. This is the fun part But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>

<p>Let your heart be your guide. You gotta think like a tree. You can spend all day playing with mountains.</p>

<p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Here's another little happy bush Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>

<p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. It's all a game of angles. Have fun with it. All those little son of a guns.</p>

<p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. That easy. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>

<p>Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. You can get away with a lot. Let that brush dance around there and play. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>

<p>We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. You can create anything that makes you happy. This piece of canvas is your world. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.</p>

<p>Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>

<p>Let's get wild today. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>

<p>Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. There we go. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

<p>I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. What the devil.</p>

<p>Get tough with it, get strong. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>

<p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. We'll have a super time. This is unplanned it really just happens. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.</p>

<p>Let all these things just sort of happen. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. The least little bit can do so much.</p>

<p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.</p>

<p>I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. You have to make these big decisions. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.</p>

<p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>

<p>These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Just a little indication. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Let's do that again.</p>

<p>There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.</p>

<p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You can do it. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>

<p>Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>

<p>You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Son of a gun. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.</p>

<p>That's crazy. Let your imagination be your guide. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>

<p>This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Here we're limited by the time we have. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>

<p>It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Isn't that fantastic? Just make a decision and let it go.</p>

<p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>

<p>How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. It's important to me that you're happy.</p>

<p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You're meant to have fun in life. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Anyone can paint. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>

<p>Just beat the devil out of it. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>

<p>We need dark in order to show light. There he comes. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. In life you need colors. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

<p>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We have a fantastic little sky! You need the dark in order to show the light. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>

<p>Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. All kinds of happy little splashes. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.</p>

<p>You have to make those little noises or it won't work. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Look at them little rascals. Only eight colors that you need. Be brave. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>
